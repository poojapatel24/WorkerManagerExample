# WorkerManagerExample

WorkManager is an Android Jetpack library that provides a flexible and efficient way to schedule and manage background tasks in your app. It is a powerful and recommended tool for managing background processing in Android applications. With WorkManager, you can schedule asynchronous, deferred, and periodic tasks that need to run even when the app is not in the foreground. WorkManager uses the most appropriate and efficient implementation for each device, depending on the API level, so you donâ€™t have to worry about managing compatibility.
